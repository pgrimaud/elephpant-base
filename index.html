        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The PHP elephpant, <em>Elephpas hypertextus</em>, was first sketched by Vincent Pontier in
            1998. For ten years it was only seen in drawings. The plush elephpant was first
            sighted in 2007. Since that time a large number of variations have been observed
            in the wild.</p>
        <a name="description"></a>
        <h3>Species Description</h3>
        <h4 id="appearance">Appearance</h4>

        <p>The typical elephpant stands 6" (15cm) tall, with ears that extend above its head,
            and 8" (20cm) long including its frayed tail. The more rare “jumbo” variety stands
            14" (26cm) tall and 20" (51cm) long. It is otherwise identical in appearance to the
            smaller animals. Due to the larger resources needed to procure a jumbo variety,
            and the increased space requirements for keeping one, they are considerably more rare.
            Not all colors have been seen in the jumbo size.</p>

        <p>The first populations of elephants seen in the wild were blue. This included both the
            main species and the first few sub-species. Eventually other populations in have been
            identified in most primary and secondary colors, and new colors are seen in the
            wild on a increasingly frequent basis.</p>

        <p>All elephpants have the PHP logo on the obverse (left) side.</p>

        <h4 id="identification">Identification</h4>

        <p>Most elephpants can be identified by color and decoration alone. Sometimes identical
            animals have been produced over multiple generations. The rear tag is the best
            way of distinguishing between generations.</p>

        <p>Sub-species of <em>Elephpas hypertextus</em> are generally identified by different
            markings on the reverse (right) side. Within the subspecies there may be variations
            of color.</p>

        <h4 id="habitat">Habitat</h4>

        <p>The elephpant's natural habitat is an work environment, and it is equally
            comfortable in both “corporate” and “home” offices. They tend to form herds on
            desks or shelves. Children and pets are often highly attracted to the animals.
            While the elephpant does not mind the attention of these groups, it can be detrimental
            to the animals' well-being and elephpant owners often keep the groups separated
            for their protection, unless they have a large herd.</p>

        <h4 id="distribution">Distribution</h4>

        <p>There is no known limit the the elephpant's range. They have been sighted on multiple
            continents and may be present in all areas of human habitation.</p>
